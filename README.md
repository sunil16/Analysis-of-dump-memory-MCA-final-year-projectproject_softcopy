Conclusion :-
Forensics analysis of physical memory is relatively a new field of research. The study started late. Although some progress has been obtained, there are still many problems. Firstly, it is a lack of reliable and practical hardware device to access physical memory. Hardware based method to get the system’s physical memory is an ideal solution as it almost doesn’t affect system’s physical memory. We could obtain a very complete physical memory without irruption by using hardware method. But the present hardware device such as Tribble, FireWire and so on still need further improvement Secondly, although there are a lot of software tools for acquisition of system’s physical memory, software tools will inevitably damage or even override the contents of physical memory. How to improve software tools to make minimize impact on physical memory is our next issue to research.

Future Scope: -
1. To write plugin approaching sql injection
2. To write plugin for memory acquisition from hypervisor and personal computer
3. To write plugin for encryption and decryption
4. To implement open source advance antivirus
5. Inbuilt linux based profile with standalone
6. To make profile independent
